# Project Reflection
Week 11 - Project 1

Experimented with for loops, while loops, and do-while loops, as well as using the Euclidian Algorithm in order to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor between two numbers.

# Comprehension Check

Compare the while loop and for loop implementations. Which loop structure felt more natural for this problem and why?

The loop structure that felt the most natural for this problem was the while loop because it is the quickest and shortest way to find the GCD of two numbers.
